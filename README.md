# Technical Interview Preparation Repository

This repository is designed for structured preparation for technical interviews, with a focus on NeetCode 150 problems and an extensive review of discrete mathematics topics relevant to software engineering and computer science fundamentals.

## About This Repository

The repository combines algorithmic problem-solving with theoretical concepts from discrete mathematics to prepare for technical interviews. The problem sets are based on the NeetCode 150, which covers essential data structures, algorithms, and complexity analysis. The discrete mathematics materials support a deeper understanding of logical reasoning, proof strategies, combinatorics, graph theory, and probability.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`neetcode-150/`**: Contains problem statements and solutions based on the NeetCode 150, with topics like arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, and graphs.
- **`discrete-mathematics/`**: Includes lecture notes, problem sets, and key concepts in discrete mathematics, covering:
  - *Logic and Proof Techniques*: Propositional and predicate logic, proof methods (direct, contrapositive, contradiction).
  - *Set Theory and Functions*: Basic set operations, functions (injections, surjections, bijections).
  - *Combinatorics*: Principles of counting, permutations, combinations, and the Pigeonhole Principle.
  - *Graph Theory*: Graph definitions, types, traversal algorithms, trees, and graph isomorphisms.
  - *Probability*: Basic principles, conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, and expected value.
- **`resources/`**: Additional reference materials in PDF form, including textbooks and notes on discrete mathematics, algorithm analysis, and more.
- **`leetcode-notes/`**: Additional explanations, tips, and solutions for LeetCode problems, organized to aid with quick review and revision.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with NeetCode 150 Problems**: Begin by working through `neetcode-150/` problems. Use this section as a hands-on way to practice data structures and algorithms essential for interviews.
2. **Study Discrete Mathematics Topics**: Complement your problem-solving with the resources in `discrete-mathematics/`. Understanding topics like combinatorics and graph theory will strengthen your analytical skills.
3. **Refer to Resources**: Use the PDFs in the `resources/` directory as references for discrete mathematics, proofs, and algorithmic strategies. These materials offer theoretical depth and examples.
4. **Review with LeetCode Notes**: Consult `leetcode-notes/` for additional solutions, tips, and explanations on specific problems, especially when revisiting complex concepts.
